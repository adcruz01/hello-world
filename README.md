# hello-world

Hello world,

I hope to contribute to and learn from this community I keep hearing about. 
My background is in marketing, but my role increasingly involves web development to support our marketing goals.
I work full time in an Australian public tech company, and recently starting consulting on the side.
My 10-12 hour days are tough but always fun and rewarding.

Hope we hear a lot from eachother,

Aaron D'
